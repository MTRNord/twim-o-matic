# twim-o-matic

Can be used to help produce new editions of <https://matrix.org/twim>.

Install everything from npm (Node 12 minimum needed) and setup needed dirs:

```bash
npm i
mkdir events
mkdir blog
mkdir blog/img
```

To use, create a file at `config/access_token.json` and include three fields:

* `accessToken` - the accessToken of the account that will used for watching (in the live environment this is @twim-o-matic:bpulse.org)
* `homeserver` - the homeserver of the watching account
* `userId` - the userId which we permit to add new emoji

Then build from TypeScript (`sourcemap` used for debugging):

```bash
npx tsc --watch *.ts --sourcemap
```

Run `node watch.js`, then use your nominated mxid to react with one of the emoji below on a story to include. This will start logging event IDs.

To clear the stored list, use `node watch.js -c`. Do this for each new post or you will include previous entries.

When you have a collection, run: `node render.js`. This will read from the test room state list, and render the entries by writing some markdown to `out.md`, which will need some editing to make it presentable.

If an entry is from the `userId` nominated in the config, that entry will not be prefixed with `>`, since we don't consider it to be quoted.

Note the options for `render` in the section below. In general, to produce a final output you will use `render -mp`, `-m` to process media, and `-p` to process results from `#ping:maunium.net`.

## node watch --help

```
% node watch --help
Usage: watch [options]

Options:
  -c, --clear  clear the stored events
  -h, --help   display help for command

Options:
  -d, --debug    output all the json blocks, suppress header
  -s, --summary  highlight missing summary blocks
  -m, --media    download and process media
  -p, --pings    get ping-room data
  -w, --web      start a server to render the result
  -h, --help     display help for command
```
